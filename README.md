## Pick Format and Abbreviations

To ensure the Football Pool Tracker functions correctly, it is important that the picks are provided in the correct format and that team abbreviations match those used by ESPN.

### Pick Format

Picks should be submitted in a CSV file with the following columns:

- `game`: The name of the bowl or game.
- `team`: The abbreviation of the team picked to win.

Each participant's picks should be in a separate CSV file named in the format `{participant_name}_picks.csv`. The `clean_data.py` script is provided to help convert an Excel file into the required CSV format.

### Team Abbreviations

The team abbreviations used in the picks must exactly match those provided by ESPN. This is crucial for the application to correctly identify the teams and update the game outcomes. If there is a mismatch in abbreviations, the application may not be able to process the picks correctly.
